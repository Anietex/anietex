# Hey there, Internet Wanderer! 👋 I'm Aniefon Umanah!

![Software Developer | Backend & Frontend Roles | Leader](banner.png)

## Who am I? 🤔

Well, I am a wizard at coding, conjuring full-stack spells with JavaScript, PHP, Typescript, VueJs/NuxtJs, Laravel, NodeJs/Express, and a bunch of other potions that no one else can pronounce. I juggle servers, dance with Docker, charm AWS, and git commit like nobody's business!

I hail from Nigeria, the home of Jollof Rice 🍚, and I am armed with a diploma in Computer Science from Akwa Ibom State Polytechnic. But hey, that's just a fancy piece of paper. My real magic comes from a potpourri of trials, errors, and a ton of caffeine.

## What do I do? 🚀

When I'm not brewing code, you'll find me on a quest integrating payment gateways, wrangling third-party APIs, and building kingdoms in the cloud, all before lunchtime.

I've played the leader's tune at Gemnote, Mezovest, and Vision Dev, guiding fellow adventurers to build mighty software constructs.

I also love to chat about the latest JavaScript trends, even when no one asked me to. After all, you've got to be passionate about your craft, right?
